<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 13"><h1>Feedback Motion
  Planning</h1>

<p>Throughout these notes we have been developing core ideas from motion planning
(especially trajectory optimization and sampling-based planning) and for feedback
control (e.g. linear and nonlinear policies). Of course these two lines of work are
deeply connected. If you have a trajectory planner that can run fast enough to be
evaluated at every control time step (e.g. model-predictive control), then the planner
can become a policy. Of course, the opposite is true, too. If you have a policy then you
can simulate it forward to generate a trajectory plan.</p>

<p>In the last chapter we started explicitly considering robustness and uncertainty.
This complicates the story (but in a beautiful way!). Feedback controllers can be
robust, or not, but the planners we've built so far start to struggle. What does it mean
for a trajectory to be robust? If we're using $\bx(\cdot), \bu(\cdot)$ to represent a
trajectory plan, then the presence of noise can make the plan infeasible. Planning
without considering the noise/uncertainty and then stablizing that plan can work in the
simple cases, but richer connections are possible.</p>

<section><h1>Parameterized feedback policies as "skills"</h1>

  <p>When I first introduced the notion of a controller, the job for the controller was
  to e.g. stabilize a fixed point, or minimize the long-term cost, for all possible
  initial conditions. Motivated initially by the ability to use linearization and linear
  optimal control to find feedback controllers even for nonlinear systems, we started to
  admit that some controllers have a more limited applicablity, and to develop tools for
  estimating their regions of attraction and/or invariant funnels around
  trajectories.</p>

  <p>One of the very original approaches to planning in artificial intelligence research
  was the <a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Research_Institute_Problem_Solver">Stanford
  Research Institute Problem Solver</a> (STRIPS) framework. The original STRIPS
  framework was for discrete states (actually boolean propositions), with the initial
  state specifid by a set of propositions and the goal state specified by another set of
  propositions. Most importantly for our discussion here, the "dynamics" were given by a
  set of actions (or "skills") which were defined by a set of <i>preconditions</i> (what
  propositions must be satisfied for the skill to be executed), and a set of
  <i>postconditions</i> (what propositions will be true if the action is executed).</p>

  <p>I'll credit <elib>Burridge99</elib> as the paper that first gave me the mental
  imagery for how regions of attraction and Lyapunov functions can help us lift the
  notions of continuous control up into this space of "skills" that can potentially be
  combined with a high-level planning framework like STRIPS. (Ironically, when I asked
  Dan Koditschek about the sequential composition of funnels idea, he credited Matt
  Mason; when I asked Matt Mason, he credited Marc Raibert; when I asked Marc Raibert,
  he said something along the lines of "oh, that's interesting..."). The picture in that
  paper is simple but powerful: a local controller combined with an estimate of its
  region of attraction defined the preconditions (also commonly referred to as the
  <i>initiation set</i>) of the skill. An associated Lyapunov function gives us the
  framework to talk about the postconditions.</p>

  <figure><img width="45%" src="figures/funnels.png"/><figcaption>A controller equipped
  with a Lyapunov function can be thought of as a "skill" with preconditions and
  postconditions, providing rules for composition.</figcaption></figure>

  <p>The field of automated reasoning / task-level planning has evolved dramatically
  since the introduction of STRIPS. The planning domain definition language (PDDL)
  <elib>Aeronautiques98+Haslum19</elib> extended the STRIPS representation to include
  more expressive features such as typed variables, conditional effects, and (even
  temporal logic) quantifiers, and served as the specification language for a
  long-running and highly influential series of <a
  href="https://www.icaps-conference.org/competitions/">ICAPS planning competitions</a>.
  </p>

  <p>We can similarly extend our notion of a continuous feedback skills to include
  parameterized skills/funnels, for instance when the skills are "goal-conditioned".</p>

  <example><h1>Koditschek's juggling robots</h1>
  
  
  </example>

  <p>This idea of planning with primitives which are feedback controllers instead of
  trajectories is potentially very powerful. Let me emphasize one of the key points:
  <i>trajectories can't be robust, but funnels can</i>.</p>
